                <p>  I grew up between Mumbai, India and Brussels, Belgium, which gave me a deep appreciation for different cultures and ways of thinking.</p>
                <p>  I'm currently studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Duke University. I'm especially interested in the overlap between machine learning, software engineering, and robotics (with a focus on Embodied AI). I am super excited about working on projects with real-world impact.</p>
                <p> Whether it's building out full-stack applications, training models, or experimenting with autonomous systems, I’m always curious and excited to learn something new. </p>

                        <p> I'm a member of the Duke Taekwondo Team and have competed in several national championships. I also help organize events and support the club's community.</p>
                        <p> I started Taekwondo after coming to Duke and both the sport and the community have since become very important parts of my life.</p>
                        <p> Last year, I earned a bronze medal at the Eastern Collegiate Taekwondo Championships hosted by Brown University.</p>

                        <p> I founded and led the Belgian branch of eNable, which became one of the most meaningful and impactful experiences of my life.</p>
                        <p>I'm still involved with the organization and currently work on developing improved control systems for 3D-printed prosthetics at Duke.</p>
